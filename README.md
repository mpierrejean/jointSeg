## jointseg

This package implements functions to quickly segment multivariate signals into piecewise-constant profiles, as well as a framework to generate realistic copy-number profiles. A typical application is the joint segmentation of total DNA copy numbers and allelic ratios obtained from Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) microarrays in cancer studies.

## Installation

You can install jointseg from github with:

    # install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("mpierrejean/jointseg")

## Usage

The main high-level joint segmentation functions are:
* `jointSeg` for arbitrary signals, see `?jointSeg`.
* `PSSeg` for bivariate copy-number signals, see `?PSSeg` and `vignette("PSSeg")`.

We also refer to  `vignette("dataGeneration")` for a description of the generation of synthetic DNA copy-number profiles using data from the `acnr` package.
